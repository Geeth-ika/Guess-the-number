This project is about generating a random number. 
in this we will select a random number which we will consider it to be a target number. User has the guess the target number i.e what is exact targetted number. 
If user have guessed the correct number we will print user have successfully completed the game. if user guessed the small number then the output gives us your number too small and 
if guessed number is bigger number it gives us number is too big guess other number.
until the user does a correct guess it gives the same output.
and once the number is guessed the output will be successfully completed.
